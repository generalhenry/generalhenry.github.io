<p>We believe code samples should be runnable. &nbsp;However code doesn't run in a vacuum, it needs an environment. &nbsp;Code samples at <a href="http://runnable.com">Runnable.com</a>, are both the code and the environment to run that code.</p>
<p>Every time you visit a project page (such as <a href="http://runnable.com/UTlPPF-f2W1TAAEX/hello-world-in-express-for-node-js">hello-world-in-express-for-node-js</a>) we look up the <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> image we have associated with it and create a container out of that image. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> container provides the code sample with the environment it needs. &nbsp;Then to bring the code and environment to life in your browser.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> enables us to give full access to a full linux instance to each user. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> is a tool set build out of two basic components, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufs">a union file system</a>, and <a href="http://linuxcontainers.org/">lxc</a>, linux containers. &nbsp;The union file system allows us to have limitless numbers of projects, the containers give us the sandboxing we need to safely give users access and <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> makes the whole thing manageable.</p>
<p>Once <a href="http://www.docker.io">Docker</a> has set up a container we need to finish up preparing the environment and expose it to the browser. &nbsp;At the core of how we do is a project called <a href="https://github.com/Runnable/dockworker">dockworker</a>. &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Runnable/dockworker">Dockworker</a> starts services, exposes a terminal (the terminal is an iframe direct to the container), exposes the filesystem, and most importantly exposes the build/run process of the project. &nbsp;In short <a href="https://github.com/Runnable/dockworker">dockworker</a> gives you the access you would expect to have locally in the browser.</p>
<p>Finally we bring it all together with a series of routers and proxies. &nbsp;Each project page visit finds an dock, creates a container and routes two subdomains to that container, one for the terminal/file access and another for the projects web output. &nbsp;Then to be able to start containers on demand, allowing users to use containers as drafts, we have a secondary routing proxy that starts the container if it's not started.</p>
<p><a href="http://runnable.com">Runnable.com</a> runs any code example that will run on linux and has web and/or terminal output. &nbsp;But that's just the start. &nbsp;We want all code to be runnable.</p>
